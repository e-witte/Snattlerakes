## Reconstructing the Ancestral State Phylogeny of the Rattlesnake Rattle

Vince Weber, Erik Witte, Shinji Yamamoto

We are attempting to recreate a phylogenentic figure from *Beahvioral Plasticity and the Origins of Novelty: The Evolution of the Rattlesnake Rattle* (Allf, Durst, & Pfennig 2016). This figure demonstrates the uniqueness of the novel trait of a tail rattle, which only evolved in rattlesnakes. Following the methods described in the paper, we will have to prune the viperidae and colubridae trees from a larger squamata phylogeny using an R package---ape (Paradris et al. 2004). Next, we will use the data from the study on tail vibration duration (sec) and vibration frequency (hz) to reproduce figure 4 from the publication. Our results ideally will produce a similar or identical phylogeny depicting propensity for tail vibration and frequency with a color ramp as a means to visualize the data in a format easily interpreted by the human eye.
